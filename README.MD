# CalderaLinker

CalderaLinker is a small python project designed to link i386 Linux shared object files into a virtual memory map and kernel, which can be started inside of a browser using [https://github.com/copy/v86](v86)

See [example](the sample project) for more details on how to use it.

## Credits

The multiboot kernel is based on [https://mars-research.github.io/posts/2020/10/hello-world-on-bare-metal/](this) example by Anton Burtsev.
