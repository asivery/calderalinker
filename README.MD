# CalderaLinker

CalderaLinker is a small python project designed to link i386 Linux shared object files into a virtual memory map and kernel, which can be started inside of a browser using [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86)

See [the sample project](example) for more details on how to use it.

## Credits

The multiboot kernel is based on [this](https://mars-research.github.io/posts/2020/10/hello-world-on-bare-metal/) example by Anton Burtsev.
